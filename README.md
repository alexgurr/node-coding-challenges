## What are the challenges for?
They could be:
- Short coding exercises, for use in interviews with candidates
- Ways for you to test yourself / test your coding abilities under pressure
- Fun exercises to help you learn Node 

&nbsp;
## How do they work / how do I get started?
The scaffolding of each challenges / app is done for you.

- Clone the whole challenges repository
- Run `yarn` or `npm install` in any of the individual challenge directories to install dependencies
- Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the application on port 3001
- Each challenge has a README with requirements for you to complete

*Some challenges might require usage of external APIs, but all information will be provided in the individual challenge readme.*

&nbsp;
## Why does it take so long for updates / new challenges?
I work on these challenges & solutions in my spare time, on top of a full time job and everything else that comes in life. Because of this, I don't always get a lot of time to maintain and add new challenges.
